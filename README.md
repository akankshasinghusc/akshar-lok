# Akshar Lok

**Akshar Lok** is a Hindi-language educational video series that introduces phonics and early language skills through short episodes. The project uses AI-assisted tools for scripting, voice synthesis, and character design. All content is manually curated with a focus on clarity, early-childhood learning, and cultural relevance.
